/* THOUGHTS LOG OF THIS PROJECT */

/*


I am Radha Krishna Kavuluru. I specialize in Artificial intelligence and Machine learning. I want to develop a website or an APP for people to use. I want to help people solve their problems and i want to build a business around it. What can i do? What are the problems which are present right now?

If it runs by the User created content then it will be great. But what content can users create? Already Facebook solves a million problems and twitter and blogs add to more solved problems. But there are always innovative push up sites like Quora and Dubsmash which have come like a bubble to the surface.

What can i build binding both Artificial Intelligence and User created Content.

Ughhh

The Everlasting question of What.

What problems exist now?

Population, Poverty , Patience :p

A Neighbourhood social network.  && A Local supply chain

A Viral system must be.
A Social Network Can't be?
Education/ But how to Solve it duh
